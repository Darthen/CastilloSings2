                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am a jazz singer living in Berlin since August 2012. I studied music at the Bern University of the Arts with jazz singing as main instrument under the guidance of two wonderful ladies of Jazz: Sandy Patton and Efrat Alony. As second instrument I had the priviledge to practice classical singing with the cantatrice Denise Bregnard. I am currently performing with a few bands in Berlin. I would love to see you at the next gig!</p>
